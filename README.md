Restaurant Reviews Classification Project

This project is focused on classifying restaurant reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By implementing a Bag of Words model with a Naive Bayes classifier, we aim to achieve effective text classification and evaluate model accuracy.

Project Overview

The Restaurant Reviews Classification project applies NLP methods to preprocess text and build a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. Using the Bag of Words model, the project transforms textual data into a structured format that can be classified as either positive or negative sentiment.
Features

This project includes:

    Text Preprocessing: Utilizing regular expressions to clean text, removing stopwords, and applying PorterStemmer to standardize word forms.
    Corpus Creation: Building a corpus for text vectorization.
    Bag of Words Model: Using Count Vectorizer to represent the text data as numeric features.
    Classification: Implementing a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
    Evaluation: Analyzing model performance with Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score.

Project Structure

The main components of this project are as follows:

    Restaurant_Reviews.py - Main script with data loading, preprocessing, and model implementation.
    README.md - Project documentation (this file).
    data/Restaurant_Reviews.csv - Dataset containing restaurant reviews with sentiment labels.

Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

bash

pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn

Usage

    Clone this repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-reviews-classification.git
cd restaurant-reviews-classification

Run the main script:

bash

    python Restaurant_Reviews.py

Results

The Naive Bayes classifier was evaluated on a set of restaurant reviews, with performance measured using:

    Accuracy Score
    Confusion Matrix

These metrics provided insights into the classifierâ€™s effectiveness in categorizing positive and negative reviews.
